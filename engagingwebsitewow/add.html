        <h1>Additional Tips for Maintaining Security on The Internet</h1>

        <h2 id="section1">Keep your software up to date</h2>
        <p><u>Software updates often include security fixes that can help protect you from bad people trying to steal your information.</p>

        <h2 id="section2">Use an ad blocker on your browser</h2>
        <p><u>ads contain trackers that intrude on your right to privacy in order to sell the "right" products to you and make more money. An adblock can prevent this.</p>

        <h2 id="section2">Be careful about what you download from the internet</h2>
        <p><u>Only download from trusted websites. Some websites could be offering different downloads that might contain viruses.</p>
